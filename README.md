# Name-The-States-Game
A small game using pandas and turtle to guess all the 50 states. 
Window will pop up with a map of the US. From there a text box for the user to input
a state. If guess is not correct (spelling must be good) then the user gets to try again. If the user is correct then the
correct guess will pop up on the map and the name will be shown to the user. This goes on till either the user types "exit"
on the text box or the user closes the window. 
After the user finishes playing the program will create a csv file of all the states not found for the user to look at and 
learn what they missed.
